Hubspot Web

### What is it ?

The idea for Project Hubspot is a simple one. Allow cafeâ€™s, events and any organizations that have internet to simply plug in a device that they can easily control online and start selling internet access for extra profit with various options to choose from with the easy to use management interface.

### And this Repo ?

This repo contains our online application that runs on App Engine.

The website handles all purchases as well as any web traffic we receive to the website.


### How is this all setup ?

The infrastructure runs on App Engine and is built locally using Grunt to manage all the tasks.

Currently we have the folllowing tasks setup for us:

* <strong>clean</strong>: Will clean all the tmp and dist directories. We run this ourselves when you are doing a release 'build'
* <strong>compile</strong>: Compiles all the scripts and styles under assets/ which are in either coffeescript or less to css and the public/dist folder.
* <strong>build</strong>: Runs a <strong>clean</strong> and <strong>compile</strong>. But then also takes those files and produces minified versions of it. The command also saves a new <strong>dist_rev</strong>. In the projects <pre>app.yaml</pre>.
* <strong>test</strong>: Runs all our local tests in test/
* <strong>deploy</strong>: Runs a <strong>build</strong>, <strong>test</strong> and then runs the app engine deploy command. This will then send the local new version up to app engine and will be serving in a few seconds. <strong style="color:red;">The site will not be deployed if the tests don't pass</strong> and we log all deploys so we know when what is happening</strong>

### Running Locally

The project uses Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/) so first things first. Do you have nodejs & grunt installed ? If not see http://nodejs.org/ & http://gruntjs.com/getting-started.

When you have grunt setup there is a quick setup script that is provided to get you running quickly. 

`````
./setup.sh
`````

When the setup is done the project should now be runnable. To start the server you need to execute:

`````
grunt run
`````

The webserver will now be running on <strong>8080</strong> and the grunt will be watching and recompling the local files in case they change.

### Deploying

To deploy the site grunt and NodeJS is required again. Please see <a href="#Running Locally">Running Locally</a>. When that's setup you can continue.

To deploy we created a local Grunt task that can just be run and the project will compile, minify all assets and upload to app engine, which I assume you have access to as you are accessing this README.
