Things that need to be done:
* Add support for crafter profile pics.
* Products and categories on Homepage should not require auth.
* Clean up image in slider.
* App "bugs out" if one submits a product with no category. Perhaps there should be a mechanism which only  
  allows to submit a product which pertains to a valid category (with stored id).
* In "Product" view, there are placeholders for additional photos, yet currently there is no way to add them. 
* Also in "Product" view, there is a placeholder for "model" - not applicable here. Suggestion: 
  "model" could be turned into summaryd/escription. Other relevant details could be added here as well.
* Page titles have been fixed, but may need to be reviewed.
* Does admin console need the standard footer w/ contact details, etc? To save space for dashboard, that could 
  be removed.
* Currently, it is necessary to do a refresh after creating/updating/deleting a record. Is there a way to improve this?
